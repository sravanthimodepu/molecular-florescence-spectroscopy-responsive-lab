1. Prepare six standard quinine sulfate solutions of following concentrations: 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 1 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
ppm (parts per million) quinine in 0.05 M H  SO  . These solutions are prepared via dilution from a 10 ppm quinine 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
stock solution in 0.05 M H  SO  . To prepare the stock solution, first exactly 6 mg of quinine sulfate dihydrate is 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
quantitatively transferred to a 500 mL volumetric flask, dissolved by adding 25 mL of 1 M H   SO   and finally made 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
up to the mark with de-ionized water. Quinine sulfate decomposes under light. Therefore, the stock solution should 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
be made fresh for measurements and stored in brown bottles in a cool place. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
Here all the solutions, including an unknown concentration solution, are shown on a concentration bar. Note that 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
the supplied unknown sample was made as follows. A 1 mL of tonic water sample (containing an unknown 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
concentration of quinine sulfate) was diluted to the mark with aq. 0.05 M H  SO   in a 100 mL volumetric flask.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
2. Carry out the excitation and emission measurements of the solutions as follows.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
3. To choose an appropriate concentration of the solution whose fluorescence has to be measured, click on the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
pointer below the concentration bar and drag it to the desired value. In real experimental measurements, one 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
should start with the lowest concentration solution first and proceed to next higher concentration and so on. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
(Why?)  
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
4. Click on the volumetric flask containing the experimental solution to take it to the instrument table.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
5. Take an all-side-transparent quartz cuvette (path length, 1 cm ×1 cm) by clicking on it.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
6. Click on the 5 mL‑capacity pipette to collect 3 mL of the experimental solution which will be transferred into the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
quartz cuvette. In real operation, one has to set the volume to 3 mL in the  pipette and an appropriate tip should 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
be attached prior to dipping it in the solution.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
7. Click on the pipette to draw the solution into it.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
8. Click on the pipette to take it out of the volumetric flask.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
9. Click on the pipette again to transfer the solution into the cuvette.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
10. Turn on the spectrofluorimeter by clicking on the power button. In real operation, it takes approx. 30 min for 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
initialization of the instrument.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
11. Click on the lid of the sample chamber of the spectrofluorimeter to open it for placing the sample in the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
instrument.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
12. To place the cuvette in the sample holder in the chamber, click on the cuvette.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
13. Click on the lid of the sample chamber to close it.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
14. To run the Excitation Spectral Scan of the sample, open the instrument set-up screen by clicking on the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
fluorescence measurement icon on the computer monitor. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
15. Select the Excitation Scan Mode on the screen.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
16. On the screen, enter the Emission wavelength: 450 nm, Excitation Start Wavelength: 270 nm and Excitation 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
End wavelength: 500 nm. One chooses the Excitation Slit (nm) and Emission Slit (nm) values (here 5 nm/5 nm) 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
and the scan speed value (here “medium”) also.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
17. To run the wavelength scan for excitation spectrum, click on 'OK' button on the set-up screen. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
18. Click on 'Close' button when spectral scan is complete. In real operation, the scan data are stored in the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
computer. The instrument stores data and therefore asks for the Sample File name. One enters a file name to 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
save the data. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
19. To run the Emission Spectral Scan of the sample, open the instrument set-up screen by clicking on the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
fluorescence measurement icon on the computer monitor. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
20. Select the Emission Scan Mode on the screen.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
21. On the screen, enter the Excitation wavelength: 350 nm, Emission Start Wavelength: 360 nm and Emission 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
End wavelength: 600 nm. One chooses the Excitation Slit (nm) and Emission Slit (nm) values (here 5 nm/5 nm) 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
and the scan speed value (here “medium”) also.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
22. To run the wavelength scan for emission spectrum, click on 'OK' button on the set-up screen. One has to be 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
sure that the solvent blank does not fluoresce in the wavelength range of interest. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
23. Click on 'Close' button when spectral scan is complete. In real operation, the scan data are stored in the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
computer. The instrument stores data and therefore asks for the Sample File name. One enters a file name to 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
save the data. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
24. To take the cuvette out of the sample chamber, first click on the sample chamber lid to open it and then on the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
cuvette. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
25. Click on the lid of the sample chamber to close it.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
26. Click on 'Reset' button to start over the measurements.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
27. Select the next higher concentration solution for measurement by clicking on the concentration selection bar 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
and carry out the Emission scan. In real measurements, if one uses the same cuvette for all the measurements, 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
every time one should rinse the cuvette by taking a small portion of the solution to be analyzed prior to filling up 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
the cuvette with the solution.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
28. Repeat the Emission scan measurements for the rest of the solutions including the unknown concentration 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
solution.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
29. Collect all data by clicking on the Data tab.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
30. Tabulate the maximum emission wavelengths for all the concentrations. If the maximum emission wavelengths 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
vary by a few nanometer from sample to sample, then one should note down the intensities at only one fixed 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
wavelength which should be ideally very near to most of the maximum emission wavelengths.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
31. Construct a calibration plot by plotting the fluorescence intensity values at a given wavelength against the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
corresponding standard concentrations. Check whether linearity relationship is valid or not. Compare the linear fits 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
first taking only the lowest five concentrations and then taking all six concentrations of quinine sulfate. Choose the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
appropriate straight line as the calibration line. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
32. By using the calibration line, determine (both graphically and mathematically) the concentration of the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
unknown sample analyzed and then the concentration of the original tonic water sample.
