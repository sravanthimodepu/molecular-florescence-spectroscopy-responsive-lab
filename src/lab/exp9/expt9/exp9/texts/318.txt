1. Prepare a 1.0 M pyridinium chloride solution and a 1.0 × 10  M anthracene solution in spectroscopy grade 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
ethanol. Since the concentration of anthracene is small, first a stock solution of 2.0 × 10  M anthracene in 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
spectroscopy grade ethanol is prepared and then it is diluted to the required concentration with the same solvent.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
2. From the above two solutions, prepare six sets of solutions with the following volume compositions: each set 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
containing 3 mL of 1.0 × 10   M anthracene solution and 0 µL, 7.5 mL, 37.5 µL, 75 µL, 112.5 µL and 150 µL of 1.0 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
M pyridinium chloride solutions, respectively.  Here these solutions are given on a scale bar for selection.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
3. Run the Emission Spectral scan of the experimental solutions as follows.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
4. To choose a solution with a given volume composition whose fluorescence has to be measured, click on the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
pointer below the composition selection bar and drag it to the desired value. On selection, the solution appears in 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
a volumetric flask. In real measurements, one should start with the lowest pyridinium chloride concentration first 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
and proceed to next higher concentration and so on. (Why?) 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
5. Click on the volumetric flask containing the solution to take it to the instrument table.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
6. Click on the all-side-transparent quartz cuvette (path length, 1 cm ×1 cm) to take it to the instrument table. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
7. Click on the 5 mL  capacity pipette to take 2 mL of 10   M anthracene solution for the  measurement. In real 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
operation, one has to set the volume to 2 mL in the pipette and an appropriate tip (in terms of size and solvent-
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
safety) should be attached prior to dipping it in the solution.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
8. Click on the same pipette to draw the solution into the pipette.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
9. Transfer the solution into the cuvette by clicking on the pipette.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
10. Turn on the spectrofluorimeter by clicking on the power button. In real operation, it takes approx. 30 min for 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
initialization of the instrument.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
11. Open the sample chamber of the spectrofluorimeter by clicking on the lid.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
12. Click on the cuvette to place it in the sample holder. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
13. Click on the chamber lid to close it.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
14. To run the Emission spectral scan, open the measurement set-up screen by clicking on the fluorescence 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
measurement icon on the computer monitor.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
15.  Select the Emission Scan Mode on the screen. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
16. On the screen, enter the Excitation wavelength: 350 nm, Emission Start Wavelength: 355 nm and Emission 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
End wavelength: 475 nm. One chooses the Excitation Slit and Emission Slit values (here 2 nm/0.5 nm) and the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
scan speed value (here “medium”) also.   
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
17. To run the wavelength scan for the emission spectrum, click on 'OK' button on the set-up screen. One has to 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
be sure that the solvent blank does not fluoresce in the wavelength range of interest. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
18. Click on 'Close' button when spectral scan is complete. In real operation, the scan data are stored in the 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
computer. The instrument stores data and therefore asks for the Sample File name. One enters a file name to 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
save the data. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
19. Take the cuvette out of the sample chamber by clicking first on the sample chamber lid to open it and then on 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
the cuvette.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
20. Close the lid of the sample chamber by clicking on it.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
21. Click on 'Reset' button to start over the measurement.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
22. Select the next higher pyridinium chloride concentration by clicking on the composition selection bar and carry 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
out the Emission scan as before. In real measurements, if one uses the same cuvette for all the measurements, 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
every time one should rinse the cuvette by taking a small portion of the solution to be analyzed prior to filling up 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
the cuvette with the solution. 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
23. Similarly, repeat the Emission spectral scans for the rest of the solutions.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
24. Collect all data by clicking on the Data tab.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
25. Determine and tabulate the values of F0 and F's for all pyridinium chloride concentrations.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
26. Construct the Stern-Volmer Plot.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
27. Determine the quenching (Stern-Volmer) constant, KSV.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
28. Calculate the specific rate constant, kq, for the quenching process. (Given: fluorescence lifetime of 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
anthracene, τ0 = 4.9 × 10‑9 sec)
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
29. Calculate the diffusion controlled rate constant, kd, for the bimolecular process in ethanol by using the relation, 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
kd = 8RT/3000η, where R is the gas constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and η is the viscosity of ethanol = 
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
1.078 cP at 25 oC.
--- RECORDSEPARATOR ---
30. Determine the value of the ratio, kq/kd, and discuss its significance.
